# WhatsApp Scraper - Implementation Summary

## Overview

WhatsApp Scraper is a screenpipe pipe that helps users extract and export messages from the WhatsApp desktop application. It uses screenpipe's operator API to automate WhatsApp UI interactions and extract text content.

## Core Functionality

1. **Application Automation**
   - Automatically opens WhatsApp desktop application
   - Navigates to specific contacts or groups
   - Scrolls through chat to load more messages

2. **Message Extraction**
   - Extracts raw text from WhatsApp UI
   - Parses text to identify individual messages
   - Detects timestamps, sender names, and message content

3. **Data Export**
   - Exports structured data in JSON or CSV format
   - Supports searching within extracted messages
   - Provides flexible display options

## Technical Implementation

### API Routes
- `/api/open-whatsapp`: Opens the WhatsApp desktop application
- `/api/search-contact`: Searches for a specific contact and opens the chat
- `/api/scrape-messages`: Extracts and parses messages from the current chat
- `/api/list-contacts`: Lists all visible contacts in the sidebar

### UI Components
- Clean, responsive UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Search functionality to filter messages
- Toggle controls for displaying timestamps and sender names
- Support for dark/light modes

### Utility Functions
- Message parsing logic to extract structured data
- Scrolling functions to load more messages
- Text extraction and processing

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Current Limitations**
   - Requires WhatsApp desktop app to be installed and logged in
   - Message parsing relies on text patterns that could change with WhatsApp updates
   - Contact names must match exactly as shown in WhatsApp

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add support for media extraction (images, videos)
   - Implement more robust message parsing
   - Add date range filtering for message extraction
   - Create a contact picker interface
   - Support automated extraction of multiple chats

## Technical Design Decisions

1. **UI Automation Approach**
   - Used screenpipe's operator API for keyboard/mouse control
   - Combined element locators with direct pixel-based input when needed
   - Implemented delays and retry logic for reliability

2. **Text Parsing Strategy**
   - Used regex patterns to identify timestamps and message boundaries
   - Implemented a state machine approach to collect multi-line messages
   - Added heuristics to identify senders in group chats

3. **User Experience**
   - Kept the UI simple and focused on the core task
   - Added clear error messages and loading states
   - Implemented search and filtering for easy message navigation
